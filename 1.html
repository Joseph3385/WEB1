<h2>Trump attorneys pursuing voting fraud 
claims snatch defeat from jaws of victory</h2>

<img src="newyork times.png" width="100%">



<p style="margin-top:50px;">Three lawyers in the national spotlight for 
their<br>defense of President Trump scored major 
public victories before the Nov. 3 election, fueling 
conservatives hopes that they could overturn the loss to 
<strong><u>Joseph R. Biden.</u></strong></p>

<p>But two months later, Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and
 Rudolph W. Giuliani failed in their mission. In the pr
ocess, judges ruled that they spread 
unfounded election conspiracy theories that were 
endorsed by the president in daily tweets. The fraud 
claims spawned the -Stop the Steal- movement, 
whose participants rallied in Washington 
on Jan. 6 and then waged a violent riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>None of the three s election fraud lawsuits - 
filled with tales of rigged voting machines, 
China and Hugo Chavez - succeeded in court.</p>
